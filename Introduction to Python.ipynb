    "## Course Description\n",
    "Python is a general-purpose programming language that is becoming ever more popular for data science. Companies worldwide are using Python to harvest insights from their data and gain a competitive edge. Unlike other Python tutorials, this course focuses on Python specifically for data science. In our Introduction to Python course, youâ€™ll learn about powerful ways to store and manipulate data, and helpful data science tools to begin conducting your own analyses.\n",

    "## Module 1. Python Basics\n",
    "An introduction to the basic concepts of Python. Learn how to use Python interactively and by using a script. Create your first variables and acquaint yourself with Python's basic data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Features\n",
    "1. **General purpose**: build anything\n",
    "2. **Open source!** Free!\n",
    "3. Python packages, also for data science\n",
    "  * Many applications and fields\n",
    "  \n",
    "Python is a versatile language. Some go to applications of Python are listed below.\n",
    "* You want to do some quick calculations.\n",
